HyDe: Hybridization Detection Using Phylogenetic Invariants
===========================================================

|Build Status| |Documentation| |PyPI Badge|

HyDe is a software package that detects hybridization in phylogenomic
data sets using phylogenetic invariants. The primary interface for HyDe is a Python
module called ``phyde`` (**P**\ ythonic **Hy**\ bridization **De**\ tection).
``phyde`` provides a suite of tools for performing hypothesis tests on triples of taxa
to detect hybridization. To ensure that the necessary
dependencies for ``phyde`` are available, we suggest using a Python distribution such
as `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__.

To facilitate analyses using the Python module, three scripts are provided to
conduct hybridization detection analyses directly from the command line:

- ``run_hyde.py``: runs a standard hybridization detection analysis on all triples
  in all directions. Results are also filtered based on whether there is significant
  evidence for hybridization.
- ``individual_hyde.py``: tests each individual within a putative hybrid population
  using a list of specified triples specified.
- ``bootstrap_hyde.py``: conducts bootstrap resampling of the individuals within
  the putative hybrid lineages for each specified triple.

These last two scripts need to be given a three column table of triples
(P1, Hybrid, P2) that you wish to test:

.. code::

  sp1 sp2 sp3
  sp1 sp3 sp4
  sp3 sp4 sp5
  .
  .
  .

You can also use a results file from a previous analysis as a triples file.
For example, you can use the filtered results from the ``run_hyde.py`` script so that
you only run analyses on triples that have significant levels of hybridization.
If you only have a few hypotheses that you want to test, then you can also pass
a triples file to ``run_hyde.py`` and it will only test those hypotheses rather than
testing everything.

Multithreaded versions of these scripts are also available (``run_hyde_mp.py``,
``individual_hyde_mp.py``, and ``bootstrap_hyde_mp.py``).
Make sure you have the ``multiprocess`` module installed before you use them:
``pip install multiprocess``.

Features
--------

- Conduct hypothesis tests using multiple individuals per population.
- Test each individual within a putative hybrid lineage to assess if
  hybridization is uniform.
- Test all possible triples of taxa and process results from within Python.
- Bootstrap individuals within taxa to assess patterns of hybrid speciation vs.
  introgression.
- Visualize the distributions of various quantities (Test Statistic, Hybridization Parameter, D-Statistic)
  using bootstrap replicates.
- Calculate the D-Statistic (ABBA-BABA) using site pattern counts returned during
  a hypothesis test.
